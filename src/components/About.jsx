      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a passionate Full Stack Developer with a strong foundation in building dynamic and responsive web applications.
        My journey in tech started with a curiosity for how things work, which quickly evolved into a love for coding and problem-solving.

      <p>
        I specialize in the MERN stack <strong>(MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)</strong> and enjoy creating seamless user experiences.
        When I'm not coding, I'm constantly learning new technologies to stay ahead in this ever-evolving field.
        I believe in the power of clean code and collaborative development to bring innovative ideas to life.
