        <strong>Sports:</strong> I love to play TableTennis and badminton in my free time as stress relief and I have also participated and won in many district tournaments in tabletennis. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Traveling:</strong> Exploring new places and cultures is my way of recharging. It broadens my horizon and sparks creativity.

      <p>
        <strong>Music</strong> Music really helps me to be active and enthusiastic and gives me a change of mood.
